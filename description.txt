Terraria has awful item scaling, so with this mod I attempt to improve it by buffing near pointless weapons and nerfing common top choices, as well as other nifty things.

Features:
- Modified weapon stats
- Added/Modified descriptions and debuffs for most weapons
- Added special attacks and effects to some weapons
- Added/Modified recipes for some weapons
- Some enemies have been rebalanced
- Some enemies have had their drops modified
- Modified mechanics, such as critical strike caps and the removal of mana sickness
- Overworld slimes replaced
- Fixed accessory tooltips
- Modified accessories

Currently finished:
- Pre-HM Melee : ye we good
- HM Melee : probably after other check-up
- Pre-HM Ranged : we gucci now
- HM Ranged : nah
- Pre-HM Mage : byeah
- HM Mage : nyet
- Pre-HM Enemies : being touched (not like that weirdo)
- HM Enemies : nuh-uh
- Other (Armor, Tools, etc) : checking up on what needs change

Thank you to: Yuyutsu, Ozzatron, pixlgray, Dominic K, termigator, Zach, Uncle Danny, Fabsol and gourd for all the coding aid!
