Terraria has awful item scaling, so with this mod I attempt to improve it by buffing near pointless weapons and nerfing common top choices, as well as other nifty things.

Features:
- Improved weapon stats, for the better and for the worst
- Increased drop rates for some weapons
- Added descriptions and debuffs for most weapons
- Added special attacks and effects to some weapons
- Added/Changed recipes for some weapons
- Reaver Shark ;)
- Sandmeme
- :crab: MANA SICKNESS IS GONE :crab:
- Mana Flower now reduces 20% magic damage
- Critical strike chance now caps at 50%

Currently finished:
- Pre-HM Melee : ye we good
- HM Melee : probably after other check-up
- Pre-HM Ranged : we gucci now
- HM Ranged : nah
- Pre-HM Mage : byeah
- HM Mage : nyet
- don't even get me started on the others
- Other (Armor, Tools, etc) : checking up on what needs change

Thank you to: Yuyutsu, Ozzatron, pixlgray, Dominic K, termigator, Zach, Uncle Danny, Fabsol and gourd for all the coding aid!
